Difference between String and StringBuilder

1. Mutability
A String is immutable in Java, while a StringBuilder is mutable in Java. An immutable object is an object whose content cannot be changed after it is created.
When we try to concatenate two Java strings, a new String object is created in the string pool. This can be demonstrated by comparing HashCode for String object after every concat operation.

2. Equality
We can use the equals() method for comparing two strings in Java since the String class overrides the equals() method of the Object class, while StringBuilder doesn’t override the equals() method of the Object class and hence equals() method cannot be used to compare two StringBuilder objects.

3. Comparable
The String class implements the Comparable interface, while StringBuilder doesn’t. To illustrate, consider the following code, which throws ClassCastException since StringBuilder doesn’t provide any mechanism for string comparison.

4. Constructor
We can create a String object without using a new operator, which is not possible with a StringBuilder.

5. Performance
StringBuilder is speedy and consumes less memory than a string while performing concatenations. This is because string is immutable in Java, and concatenation of two string objects involves creating a new object.

6. Length
Since String is immutable, its length is fixed. But StringBuilder has the setLength() method, which can change the StringBuilder object to the specified length.
